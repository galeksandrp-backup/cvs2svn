                       Hacker's Guide To cvs2svn
                      ===========================

This project uses the same social and technical guidelines (where
applicable) as Subversion itself.  You can view them online at
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/www/hacking.html.

Also:

   - Read design-notes.txt, you won't regret it.
   - Read the class documentation in cvs2svn.
   - Please put a new test in run-tests.py when you fix a bug.
   - Use 2 spaces between sentences in comments and docstrings.
     (This helps sentence-motion commands in some editors.)

Happy hacking!


Making releases
===============

 Pre-release (repeat as appropriate):
  A. Run the testsuite, check everything is OK.
  B. Trial-run ./dist.sh, check the output is sane.

 Creating the release:
  1. Set VERSION in dist.sh, and then run:
       svn copy . http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/tags/x.y.z
  2. Increment the -dev VERSION in dist.sh on the trunk or branch.
  3. Switch to the tag URL.
  4. Run:
       ./dist.sh

 Publishing the release:
  5. Upload tarball to website download area.
  6. Move old releases in the 'Old' folder of the download area.
  7. Create a project announcement on the website.
  8. Send an announcement to announce@cvs2svn.tigris.org.
