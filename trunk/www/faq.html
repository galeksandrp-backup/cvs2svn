<h2>How-to:</h2>

<h3><a name="oneatatime" title="#oneatatime">How can I convert my CVS repository one module at a time?</a></h3>

<p>If you need to convert certain CVS modules (in one large
repository) to Subversion
<b>now</b> and other modules <b>later</b>, you may want to convert
your repository one module at a time.  This situation is typically
encountered in large organizations where each project has a separate
lifecycle and schedule, and a one-step conversion process is not
practical.
</p>

<p>To incrementally migrate modules contained within a CVS repository
to Subversion you will need to use cvs2svn to create a "dumpfile".
Then, using <tt>svnadmin</tt> you will load the dumpfile into a
project directory created within the Subversion repository.  For
example:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>If the svn repository doesn't already exist, create it:
    <pre>
      svnadmin create file:///path/to/svnrepos
    </pre></li>

  <li>Remember to <b>Make a backup</b> before starting.  Never run
    cvs2svn on a live CVS repository--always work on a copy of your
    repository.</li>

  <li>Run cvs2svn against one of the modules you want converted:
    <pre>
      # Copy the CVS modules into a temporary cvs repository.
      # This is not absolutely necessary, but it's for safety's sake.
      $ mkdir ~/newcvsrepo
      $ mkdir ~/newcvsrepo/CVSROOT # needed by cvs2svn --use-cvs
      $ cp -r /oldcvsrepo/projectA ~/newcvsrepo

      # Create a dumpfile containing the new CVS repository contents
      $ mkdir ~/svndump; cd ~/svndump
      $ cvs2svn --dump-only ~/newcvsrepo/projectA
    </pre></li>


  <li>Import the dump into the Subversion repository:
    <pre>
      # Make a directory for the project.
      $ svn mkdir file:///path/to/svnrepos/projectA -m "Added projectA directory."

      # Use "svnadmin load" to load the dumpfile.
      $ cd ~/svndump
      $ svnadmin --parent-dir projectA load /path/to/svnrepo &lt; cvs2svn-dump
    </pre></li>

  <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each module you want to convert.</li>

</ol>


<h3><a name="inverted" title="#inverted">How can I convert project <tt>foo</tt> so
    that <tt>trunk/tags/branches</tt> are inside of
    <tt>foo</tt>?</a></h3>

  <p>Given a CVS repository with the layout:</p>

<pre>
  /project_a
  /project_b
</pre>

  <p>cvs2svn will produce a Subversion repository with the following
    layout:</p>

<pre>
   trunk/
      project_a/
         ...
      project_b/
         ...
   tags/
      ...
   branches/
      ...
</pre>

  <p>However, you may want your Subversion repository to be laid out
    like this:</p>

<pre>
   project_a/
      trunk/
         ...
      branches/
         ...
      tags/
         ...
   project_b/
      trunk/
         ...
      branches/
         ...
      tags/
         ...
</pre>

  <p>Currently, cvs2svn does not support converting a repository in
    this manner (see <a
    href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=86">Issue
    #86</a> for details), however, there is a workaround.  You can
    convert your repository one project (or module) at a time and load
    the individual dumpfiles into your Subversion repository using
    <tt>svnadmin</tt> with the <tt>--parent-dir</tt> switch.  See the
    answer to <a href="#oneatatime">How can I convert my CVS
    repository one module at a time?</a> for details.</p>

<h2>Problems:</h2>

<h3><a name="atticprob" title="#atticprob">I get an error "A CVS
    repository cannot contain both repo/path/file.txt,v and
    repo/path/Attic/file.txt,v".  What can I do?</a></h3>

<p>Background: Normally, if you have a file called
<tt>path/file.txt</tt> in your project, CVS stores its history in a
file called <tt>repo/path/file.txt,v</tt>.  But if <tt>file.txt</tt>
is deleted on the main line of development, CVS moves its history file
to a special <tt>Attic</tt> subdirectory:
<tt>repo/path/Attic/file.txt,v</tt>.  (If the file is recreated, then
it is moved back out of the <tt>Attic</tt> subdirectory.)  Your
repository should never contain both of these files at the same
time.</p>

<p>This cvs2svn error message thus indicates a mild form of corruption
in your CVS repository.  The file has two conflicting histories, and
even CVS does not know the correct history of <tt>path/file.txt</tt>.
The corruption was probably created by using tools other than CVS to
backup or manipulate the files in your repository.  With a little work
you can learn more about the two histories by viewing each of the
<tt>file.txt,v</tt> files in a text editor.</p>

<p>There are four straightforward approaches to fixing the repository
corruption, but each has potential disadvantages.  Remember to <b>make
a backup</b> before starting.  Never run cvs2svn on a live CVS
repository--always work on a copy of your repository.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Remove the <tt>Attic</tt> version of the file and restart the
    conversion.  Sometimes it represents an old version of the file
    that was deleted long ago, and it won't be missed.  But this
    completely discards one of the file's histories, probably causing
    <tt>file.txt</tt> to be missing in older historical revisions.
    (For what it's worth, this is probably how CVS would behave in
    this situation.)

    <pre>
      # You did make a backup, right?
      $ rm repo/path/Attic/file.txt,v
    </pre></li>

  <li>Remove the non-<tt>Attic</tt> version of the file and restart
    the conversion.  This might be appropriate if the
    non-<tt>Attic</tt> version has less important content than the
    <tt>Attic</tt> version.  But this completely discards one of the
    file's histories, probably causing <tt>file.txt</tt> to be missing
    in recent historical revisions.

    <pre>
      # You did make a backup, right?
      $ rm repo/path/file.txt,v
    </pre></li>

  <li>Rename the <tt>Attic</tt> version of the file and restart the
    conversion.  This avoids losing history, but it changes the name
    of the <tt>Attic</tt> version of the file to
    <tt>file-from-Attic.txt</tt> whenever it appeared, and might
    thereby cause revisions to be broken.

    <pre>
      # You did make a backup, right?
      $ mv repo/path/Attic/file.txt,v repo/path/Attic/file-from-Attic.txt,v
    </pre></li>

  <li>Rename the non-<tt>Attic</tt> version of the file and restart
    the conversion.  This avoids losing history, but it changes the
    name of the non-<tt>Attic</tt> version of the file to
    <tt>file-not-from-Attic.txt</tt> whenever it appeared, and might
    thereby cause revisions to be broken.

    <pre>
      # You did make a backup, right?
      $ mv repo/path/file.txt,v repo/path/file-not-from-Attic.txt,v
    </pre></li>
