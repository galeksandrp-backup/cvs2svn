This is a python script which converts a CVS repository to an SVN Repository.

It works by:

  * using the rcsparse.py module to directly read the CVS repository
    and deduce commits,

  * creating a bunch of temporary scratchwork on disk,

  * replaying all of the commits into a new SVN repository.

Most of the script was written by Greg Stein (gstein@lyra.org) and
Daniel Berlin (dberlin@dberlin.org).


** As of September 2002, this script works reasonably well, with two
   big caveats:

     - it doesn't yet detect branches or tags

     - there may be tiny bugs in the way it deduces CVS commits.

   That said, the script has been used on straightforward CVS
   repositories with no real problems.  As an example, the whole first
   year of Subversion's own history was converted from CVS into a
   3000+ revision svn repository.  It took about 30 minutes.


** To use this script:

     - Get at least python 2.0.

     - Install the rcsparse.py module.  It's a part of the ViewCVS project.

     - Install the python swig bindings, so that python can directly
       invoke libsvn_fs routines.  See the INSTALL file in
       subversion/bindings/swig/.
