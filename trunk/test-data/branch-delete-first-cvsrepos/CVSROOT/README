This CVSROOT/ directory is only here to convince CVS that this is a
real repository.  Without it, CVS operations fail with an error like:

  cvs [checkout aborted]: .../main-cvsrepos/CVSROOT: No such file or directory

Of course, CVS doesn't seem to require that there actually be any
files in CVSROOT/, which kind of makes one wonder why it cares about
the directory at all.

This repository exhibits has interesting characteristic that the very
first thing that happen on a branch is that its sole file is deleted.
A bug in cvs2svn caused this to delay branch creation until the end of
the program (where we're finished off branches and tags), which
resulted in the file's deletion from the branch never really happening.
