The files here are a hand-constructed verification (in progress) of
what cvs2svn.py should produce when run on 'main-cvsrepos'.  The
regression suite's expectations will eventually be based on this.

I'm just saving this data here because it took long enough to
generate, and is undergoing complex enough massages, that it's worth
versioning.  You probably want to ignore it unless you're me.
