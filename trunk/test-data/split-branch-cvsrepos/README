This tree is for reproducing

   http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1421

There are two sets of reproduction data - 'src' and 'module'.

'src' directory

  The reproduction data was constructed using bits of the xiph.org
  repository, supplied by Jack Moffitt <jack@xiph.org>.

  The problem has to do with the creation of branch 'volsung_20010721',
  parts of which are copied from trunk, and other parts from branch
  'xiphophorus':

     src/ao_private.h,v:
        volsung_20010721   ==> 1.1.0.2

     src/audio_out.c,v:
          volsung_20010721 ==> 1.15.0.2
          xiphophorus      ==> 1.1.1

     src/COPYING,v
          volsung_20010721 ==> 1.1.1.1.0.4
          xiphophorus      ==> 1.1.1

  (These are actually from /ao/src/ in the xiphrepo; note that COPYING,v
  is actually /ao/COPYING,v in the original data, I just moved it to
  make the reproduction simpler.)

  This test began to pass after the fix in r6534. However, similar errors still
  occurred with other data sets. The issue was reopened.

'module' directory

  This test is based on issue-1421-small-cvsrepos.tgz from Blair Zajac.

  It continued to fail until the final fix in r7006.

See the issue for more details.
