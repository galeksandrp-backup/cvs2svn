(This README file is not an RCS ,v file, so cvs2svn won't notice it.)

This directory, the `proj' project, is for testing cvs2svn's ability
to group revisions correctly along tags and branches.  Here is its
history:

  1.  The initial import (revision 1.1 of everybody) created a
      directory structure with a file named `default' in each dir:

            ./
              default
              sub1/default
                   subsubA/default
                   subsubB/default
              sub2/default
                   subsubA/default
              sub3/default

  2.  Then tagged everyone with T_ALL_INITIAL_FILES.

  3.  Then tagged everyone except sub1/subsubB/default with
      T_ALL_INITIAL_FILES_BUT_ONE.

  4.  Then created branch B_FROM_INITIALS on everyone.

  5.  Then created branch B_FROM_INITIALS_BUT_ONE on everyone except
      /sub1/subsubB/default.

  6.  Then committed modifications to two files: sub3/default, and
      sub1/subsubA/default.

  7.  Then committed a modification to all 7 files.

  8.  Then backdated sub3/default to revision 1.2, and
      sub2/subsubA/default to revision 1.1, and tagged with T_MIXED.

  9.  Same as 8, but tagged with -b to create branch B_MIXED.

  10. Switched the working copy to B_MIXED, and added
      sub2/branch_B_MIXED_only.  (That's why the RCS file is in
      sub2/Attic/ -- it never existed on trunk.)

  11. In one commit, modified default, sub1/default, and
      sub2/subsubA/default, on branch B_MIXED.

  12. Did "cvs up -A" on sub2/default, then in one commit, made a
      change to sub2/default and sub2/branch_B_MIXED_only.  So this
      commit should be spread between the branch and the trunk.
