                      ===========================
                       Hacker's Guide To cvs2svn
                      ===========================

This project uses the same social and technical guidelines (where
applicable) as Subversion itself.  You can view them online at
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/www/hacking.html.

Also:

   - Read design-notes.txt, you won't regret it.
   - Read the class documentation in cvs2svn.
   - Please put a new test in run-tests.py when you fix a bug.
   - Use 2 spaces between sentences in comments and docstrings.
     (This helps sentence-motion commands in some editors.)

Happy hacking!


Making releases
===============

 Pre-release (repeat as appropriate):
   A. Backport changes if appropriate.
   B. Update CHANGES.
   C. Run the testsuite, check everything is OK.
   D. Trial-run ./dist.sh, check the output is sane.

 Creating the release:
   1. If this is an A.B.0 release, make a branch:
        svn copy http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/trunk \
          http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/branches/A.B.x
      and then increment the -dev VERSION in cvs2svn on trunk.
   2. Set the release date in CHANGES on trunk.
   3. Switch to a branch working copy.
   4. Merge CHANGES to the release branch.
   5. Set VERSION in cvs2svn and then run:
        svn copy . http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/tags/A.B.C
   6. Increment the -dev VERSION in cvs2svn on the A.B.x branch.
   7. Switch to the tag.
   8. Run:
        ./dist.sh

 Publishing the release:
   9. Upload tarball to website download area.
  10. Move old releases into the 'Old' folder of the download area.
  11. Create a project announcement on the website.
  12. Send an announcement to announce@cvs2svn.tigris.org.
  13. Update the topic on #cvs2svn.
