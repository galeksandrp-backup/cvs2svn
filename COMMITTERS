The following people have commit access to cvs2svn.  This is not a
full list of cvs2svn's authors, however -- for that, you'd need to
look over the log messages to see all the patch contributors.

If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail
dev@cvs2svn.tigris.org, rather than mailing any of these people
directly.
