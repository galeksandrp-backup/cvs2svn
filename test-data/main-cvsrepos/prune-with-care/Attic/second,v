log
@Remove the file 'second'.

Since 'first' was already removed, removing 'second' empties the
directory, so the directory itself gets pruned.
@
text
@The original text of this file was much longer, but we didn't
need it for the regression test, so we removed it.  It was
src/gnu/usr.bin/cvs/contrib/pcl-cvs/Attic/NEWS,v in the FreeBSD CVS
repository.
