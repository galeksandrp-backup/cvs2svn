                      ===========================
                       Hacker's Guide To cvs2svn
                      ===========================

This project uses the same social and technical guidelines (where
applicable) as Subversion itself.  You can view them online at
http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/HACKING.

Also:

   - Read design-notes.txt, you won't regret it.
   - Read the class documentation in cvs2svn.py.
   - Please put a new test in run-tests.py when you fix a bug.
   - Use 2 spaces between sentences in comments and docstrings.
     (This helps sentence-motion commands in some editors.)

Enjoy!
