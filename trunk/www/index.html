Note: cvs2svn is not yet "1.0 quality" software.  It may convert your
repository successfully, or it may error.  In the worst case, it may
<i>appear</i> to convert your repository successfully but actually
introduce subtle inaccuracies into the revision history.  Please watch
its output for warnings and errors, and mail <a
href="/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">dev@cvs2svn.tigris.org</a>
if you encounter any problems.  You can also ask questions on the

<h3>What Is cvs2svn?</h3>

<p>cvs2svn.py is a Python script that converts a CVS repository to a
Subversion repository.  It is designed for one-time conversions, not
for repeated synchronizations between CVS and Subversion.</p>

<p>cvs2svn.py is not yet packaged for wide distribution.  If you would
like to try it, please use Subversion to check out a working copy from 
<a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/cvs2svn/trunk/"
>http://svn.collab.net/repos/cvs2svn/trunk/</a>
and read the <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/cvs2svn/trunk/README"
>README</a> file there.
