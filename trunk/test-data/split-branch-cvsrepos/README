The reproduction data was constructed using bits of the xiph.org
repository, supplied by Jack Moffitt <jack@xiph.org>.

The problem has to do with the creation of branch 'volsung_20010721',
parts of which are copied from trunk, and other parts from branch
'xiphophorus':

   src/ao_private.h,v:
      volsung_20010721   ==> 1.1.0.2

   src/audio_out.c,v:
	volsung_20010721 ==> 1.15.0.2
	xiphophorus      ==> 1.1.1

   src/COPYING,v
	volsung_20010721 ==> 1.1.1.1.0.4
	xiphophorus      ==> 1.1.1

(These are actually from /ao/src/ in the xiphrepo; note that COPYING,v
is actually /ao/COPYING,v in the original data, I just moved it to
make the reproduction simpler.)

See the issue for more details.
