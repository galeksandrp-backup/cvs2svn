                        REPORTING BUGS
                        ==============

This document tells how and where to report bugs in cvs2svn.  It is
not a list of all outstanding bugs -- we use an online issue tracker
for that, see

   http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/project_issues.html

Before reporting a bug, check to see if it is already filed in the
issue tracker.  If it is not, then mail your bug report to
dev@cvs2svn.tigris.org.

To be useful, a bug report should include the following information:

   * The revision of cvs2svn.py you ran.  Look for a line like
     "$LastChangedRevision: 789 $" near the top of cvs2svn.py (the
     number will probably be different, of course).

   * The version of Subversion you used it with.

   * The exact cvs2svn.py command line you invoked, and the output it
     produced.

   * The data you ran it on.  If your CVS repository is small (only a
     few kilobytes), then just provide the repository itself.  If it's
     large, or if the data is confidential, then please try to come up
     with some smaller, releasable data set that still stimulates the
     bug.  Often this is just a matter of invoking cvs2svn on deeper
     subdirectories, until you find the minimal reproduction case.

The most important thing is that we be able to reproduce the bug :-).
If we can reproduce it, we can usually fix it.  If we can't reproduce
it, we'll probably never fix it.  So describing the bug conditions
accurately is crucial.  If in addition to that, you want to add some
speculations as to the cause of the bug, or even include a patch to
fix it, that's great!

Thank you in advance,
